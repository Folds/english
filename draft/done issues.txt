This file lists issues that have been either marked won't do,
or demonstrably fixed and automatically regression-tested
in the Plain English programming environment.
The Plain English programming environment is called Cal.
Currently, the file has a .txt extension,
so that it will not be compiled into the executable.

The list of outstanding issues is in issues.txt.
The list of demonstrably fixed
  (but not yet automatically regression tested)
  issues is in demoed_fixes.txt

\ ======================================   

Here is how the issues are rated:
  Of course, all of the ratings are guesses.
  A difficulty rating can be one of the following:
     Already done.
     Already done, but would be easier with an alias.
     Already done, but the natural alias conflicts
                   with another feature of Cal.
     Trivial.  It needs just a short procedure.
     Easy.  It needs less than a screenful of code.
     Medium.
     Hard.
     Profound.  It needs a different way of doing things,
       which is either not easy to design, or is hard
       to make consistent with the project's design goals.

  An implementation difficulty rating is a difficulty rating.
    It describes how hard it is to implement a feature or bug-fix.
  A demoing difficulty rating is a difficulty rating.
    It describes how hard it is to try out the feature or bug-fix,
    to be confident that it works.
  A testing difficulty rating is a difficulty rating.
    It describes how hard it is to write automated unit tests
    for the feature, to be confident that other feature changes
    and/or refactorings do not break the feature.
    Automated unit tests can be run frequently
   (such as every time the program is compiled),
    so most tests need to be very fast.

  A benefit rating can be one of the following:
    Probably a very bad idea.  Would not work well,
      or would make other things not work well.
    Probably does more harm than good.
    Might do more harm than good.
    Neutral.
    Minor benefit.
    Important.
    Very important.
    Critical.

  An audience can be one of the following:
    An Plain English-only programmer.
      A programmer who chooses to only program in Plain English.
    A Windows programmer.  An English-speaking programmer
      who uses a native-Windows computer, and expects
      Windows-like functionality.
    A Linux programmer.  An English-speaking programmer
      who uses a *nix computer and expects some
      Windows-like functionality.
      Because Cal is currently available only for Wintel platforms,
      a Linux programmer will use WINE to run Cal.
   An application user.  A person who uses Plain English
      because of a cool feature available in it
      (such as the editor, or the pdf writer),
      but avoids adding new procedures.
   (Please add more audiences as needed.)

A status rating can be one of the following:
   A vague idea.
   A request.  It is possible to think about how it might be done,
     and what the trade-offs might be.
   Designed.
   Planned test(s).
   Implemented.
   Demonstrated.
   Tested.  (With automated unit tests.)
   Refactored.  It has been incorporated into the program
     in a way that makes the overall system as simple as practical.
   Won't do.  While any user is welcome to implement any feature
     on their own computer, there are no plans to implement the feature
     in the standard version of the software.
  The request date.
  Who made the request.
  Who implemented the request.
  Who tested the implementation.

\ ======================================   
   
The following requests have either been completed, or marked as "Won't do."
The program's change log is implicit
in the source code repository's change log.
Occasionally, more fixed items should be moved from issues.txt.

022 - not applicable.  CAL-3040 already compiles all
  files (that do not have extensions) that are in
  the project directory, regardless of whether
  they are open in the editor.

023 - not applicable.  The documentation already discusses
  which files CAL compiles.
  
026.  The End key works similarly to other environments.
  Currently:
    The End key moves the cursor to the end of the current line.
    Ctrl-End moves the cursor to the end of the current file.
  Audience:  programmers.
  Status:  Demonstrated.  This feature is part of CAL-3040.
  Implementation difficulty:  Done, as part of CAL-3040.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Profound.

027.  The Home key works similarly to other environments.
  Currently:
    The Home key moves the cursor to the start of the current line.
    Ctrl-Home moves the cursor to the start of the current file.
  Audience:  programmers.
  Status:  Demonstrated.  This feature is part of CAL-3040.
  Implementation difficulty:  Done, as part of CAL-3040.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Profound.

001.  By default, run automated unit tests immediately after each compilation.
  This could be disabled by a configuration option.
  Show the results in a convenient way.  If necessary,
  the tests can be manually grouped into a high-level procedure.
  Audience:  programmers.
  Status:  tested.
  Benefit:  Critical.  Frequently running a comprehensive
    automated test suite makes it much easier, safer, and faster
    to refactor and/or add features.
  Implementation difficulty:  High.
  Demoing difficulty:  Trivial.
  Testing difficulty:  Trivial.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

049.  On WINE systems, show WINE's complaint about memory leak(s).
  Currently, the "wine cmd" shell reports something like the following after Cal quits:
fixme:heap:HeapSetInformation 0x110000 0 0x40bc08 4
  Audience:  Linux programmers.
  Status:  Won't do.  CAL-3040 already shows its debug complaint about memory leaks
    on WINE systems.  WINE's documentation states that WINE produces many fixme
    complaints, most of which can be ignored.
  Benefit:  Neutral.
  Implementation difficulty:  Profound.
  Demo difficulty:  Hard, unless the programmer is using WINE (which makes it easy).
  Test difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

052.  On WINE systems, prevent the following error message:
  Currently, the "wine cmd" shell reports something like the following after Cal quits:
fixme:font:RemoveFontMemResourceEx (0x8771ccb9) stub
  Audience:  Linux programmers.
  Status:  Won't do.  This is caused by WINE having only implemented a stub
    for "RemoveFontMemResourceEx".
  Implementation difficulty:  Profound.
  Benefit:  neutral.
  Demo difficulty:  Hard, unless the programmer is using WINE (which makes it easy).
  Test difficulty:  Profound.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

088.  Add a test that the regression tests finished in an acceptable time.
  For example, 10 seconds or 3600 seconds.
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Status:   Tested.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Easy.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

061.  Make it easy to open all of the files in a project.
  Audience: Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Status:  Demonstrated in CAL-3040.  The de facto project file
    is all files (that lack file extensions) in the same folder
    as the active source when the compile or run feature is chosen.
  Implementation difficulty:  Done in CAL-3040.
  Demoing difficulty:  medium.
  Testing difficulty:  medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.
  
062.  Allow using the Desktop after documents have been loaded into the editor.
  This might require using a tab for the purpose.
  Audience:  All users.
  Status:   Demonstrated in CAL-3040.  All blank tabs have this feature.
  Implementation difficulty:  Done in CAL-3040.
  Demoing difficulty:  Trivial.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

063.  Allow opening files that are selected in the project file.
  Audience:  Windows programmers.
  Status:  Demonstrated in CAL-3040.  The de facto project file
    is all files (that lack file extensions) in the same folder
    as the active source when the compile or run feature is chosen.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Done in CAL-3040.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.
  
039.  Allow the user to decide whether to regression test each build.
  This could be implemented by only running the regression tests
  the first time the user clicks on the status.  This would eliminate
  the risk of an infinite loop or null pointer exception preventing
  the user from seeing that the program compiled quickly and successfully.
  Audience: Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Status:   Demonstrated.
  Benefit:  Very important.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Profound.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

087.  Show how long it took to run the regression tests in the status,
  upon completion of the regression tests.
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Status:    Demonstrated.
  Benefit:  Very important.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Profound.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

003.  Gray out (and disable) unused menu letters.
  Cal has an alphabetical menu structure.
  Currently, many of the letters do not have menu items.
  These blank menu letters look like they have menus, though.
  This is confusing to users, and makes it hard
  for them to learn what menus are available.
  Status:  Tested.  (Specifically,
    tested that the "q" menu's temporary color is the command's color,
    whereas the "z" menu's temporary color is the desktop color.
    If the q menu is empty (in other words, does not include "quit"),
    and/or if the z menu is populated, the test code will need to be changed.
  Benefit:  Important.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  all users.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

009.  Allow the user to change programs by clicking on a program outside of Cal.
  Currently, a Linux/Wine/Cal user has to
  press Alt-Tab-Tab to change to another program.
  The program could notice if a mouse click
  is outside of the program's window.
  If so, and if the program is not in the middle of something important,
  the program could yield control to the windowing system.
  The status is demonstrated.
  The audiences are Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  The benefit is important -- most Windows and Linux programmers
    alternate working in their IDEs and doing other things.
  The difficulty is medium.  It requires modifying mouse event handler(s)
    to call the pre-existing yield feature.
  Demoing would be easy.  Windows programmers and Linux programmers
    would demo it all the time, but full-screen users would only demo it
    when Cal did not occupy the full screen.
  Testing would be profound.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

010.  Allow the program to share the screen with other programs.
  The benefit is important -- most Windows and Linux programmers
    alternate working in their IDEs and doing other things.
    This feature would also allow Plain English-only programmers
    to have two side-by-side instances of Cal,
    and copy-and-paste between the instances.
  The difficulty is hard, because the
    "Don't hide programs outside of the program's window"
    sub-feature is hard.
  The status is demonstrated.
  The audiences are Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Demoing would be easy.  Windows programmers and Linux programmers
    would demo it all the time, but full-screen users
    would only demo it when Cal did not occupy the full screen
    (or when they use two side-by-side instances of Cal).
  Testing would be profound.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

030.  Show minimize, restore, and maximize buttons at the top right corner.
  Status:  Tested.
  Audience:  Windows programmers.
  Benefit:  Important.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.  Just tested that the trio has 3 commands.
    Did not test whether the trio is displayed.  Depending on the
    main window size, sometimes the trio is deliberately not displayed.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

097.  Refactor test code so that each test needs less code.
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Status:  Tested.
  Benefit:  Important -- makes it much easier to write tests.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Not applicable.
  Requested by Gerry Rzeppa on March 18, 2014.

095.  Identify whether the program is running on WINE.
  Benefit:  Important.  This would allow commenting out features
    that do not work on WINE, but do work on Windows
    (such as minimizing, and text-to-speech).
  Audience:  Linux programmers.
  Status:  Tested.
  Implementation difficulty:  Profound.
  Demoing difficulty:  Hard.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.  Tested whether CAL can
    check if a library contains a particular procedure.
    The WINE check looks for "wine_get_version" in "ntdll.dll".
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 17, 2014.

079.  Allow font heights to be added dynamically to the menus.
  Specifically, do not require the corresponding menu handler
  to be hardcoded in the menu handler switch.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Status:  Tested.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

100.  In the font height submenu, sort by height from tallest to shortest, then offer the other... option.

  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Status: Tested.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

029.  If the font is fixed width, show a subtle line at the 80 character mark.
  The intent is that if the user chooses to have a fixed width font,
  then make it easy for the user to manually line wrap.
  Audience:  Linux programmers -- this is a feature of IntelliJ.
  Status:  Tested.
  Benefit:  Minor
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.  Tested the code to check
    if the current font is fixed-width or proportional.
    Did not test if the line is present.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

083.  Highlight the current font height on the font height submenu.
  If (and only if) the current font height is not on the font height submenu,
  highlight the "Other" submenu item.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Status:  Tested.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

071.  Add standard fonts to the menu.
  The following four fonts are standard on Windows computers:
  Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, and Symbol.
  The old default font was standard in CAL.
  For each of these five fonts that is present,
  include the font in a font name submenu.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Important.
  Status: Tested.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

072.  Add an "Other" option to the font name submenu,
  which does what CAL-3040's "Font Name..." menu item does:
  ask the user in the dialog to type in a font name.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Trivial.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Status: Tested.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

077.  Highlight the current font name on the font name submenu.

  highlight the "Other" submenu item.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Status: Tested.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

076.  In the font name submenu,
  use each font to display the font name.
  For example, courier new would be in courier new,
  and arial would be in arial.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Status: Tested.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Status: Tested.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

085.  In the font height submenu,
  for each font height that is shorter than the default font height,
  show the font height in its own height.
  For example, if the default font height is 1/4 inch:
  the font height submenu would show "1/8 Inch" smaller than "1/4 Inch",
  but it would show "1/2 Inch" the same size as "1/4 Inch".
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Status: Tested.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

075.  If the current font (in the editor or writer pad)
  is not otherwise listed in the font name submenu, include it.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Status: Tested.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

045.  Change the sort order of byte and key declarations.
As of March 7, 2014, the byte and key declarations
were scattered throughout the noodle.  Since then,
they have been moved to the 'characters' file.
  Audience:  Linux programmers.
  Status:  Won't do.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  easy.
  Demo difficulty:  Easy.
  Test difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

046.  Change the sort order of color declarations.
As of March 7, 2014, the color declarations were scattered
throughout the noodle.  Since then,
they have been moved to the 'colors' file.
  Audience:  Linux programmers.
  Status:  Won't do.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  easy.
  Demo difficulty:  Easy.
  Test difficulty:  Medium.

018.  Only ask "Are you quite sure [you want to quit]" if there is unsaved work.
  Ask the user if they want to save the files.
  Update the documentation accordingly.
  Audience:  all users.
  Status:  Won't do.
  Benefit:  minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  medium.
  Testing difficulty:  medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

043.  Add a "frequently used" menu bar.
   Most of the time, a user only uses a few features from the menus.
   For example, when writing and running code, a user is likely to use:
   Comment, Find, Find Next, Open, Quit, Run, Save, Save As, Uncomment, Undo
   It would be possible to keep track of which menu commands
   have been called (using the menus, ignoring uses via Ctrl- keys)
   during the past arbitrary number of menu commands.
   It would also be possible to calculate how many menu items
   would fit in a horizontal row beneath the alphabetical menu.
   The most frequently used menu items could be put in such a row,
   in alphabetical order.  If no menu items have ever been used,
   the row could default to a few typical commands,
   with the rest of the row blank.
   Status:  Won't do.
   Audience:  Windows programmers.
   Benefit:  Minor.  It might make the system much easier to use.
   Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
   Demoing difficulty:  Hard, because of the lag
     due to the arbitrary number of recent uses.
   Testing difficulty:  Medium.  It would be possible to set up a mock menu,
       pass it a history of menu clicks, and verify which menu items
       appear in the mock frequently used menu.
       It would also be easy to verify that
       the real frequently used menu is visible.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

044.  Update the documentation to discuss the "frequently used menu" bar.
  Audience:  all users.
  Status:   Won't do.
  Benefit:  Important -- the documentation needs to be accurate.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demo difficulty:  Easy.
  Test difficulty:  not applicable.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

006.  Hide unused tabs in the tab-strip.
  Cal has a tab-strip at the bottom of its screen.
  The tab-strip shows blank tabs for tabs
    that have not been populated with documents yet.
  This confuses users.
  The request is to hide all but one of the unused tabs.
  The one blank tab will let users start working on a new document.
  When the user starts working on a new document, unhide another tab.
  Benefit:  Might do more harm than good.
  Status:   Won't do.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Windows programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

  Testing difficulty:  Easy.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on February 24, 2017.

107.  Extract parameter values from command line arguments.
  For example:
  mycommand arg1 arg2= arg3=value arg4="another value"
  should produce empty strings for arg1 and arg2's parameter values,
  value for arg3's parameter value,
  and "another value" (with the quotes) for arg4's parameter value.
  This behavior matches a convention for C#/SCOPE programming.
  Status:   Already done.
  Benefit:  Medium.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Easy.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on February 26, 2017.

108.  Extract the program name from the command line.
  The zeroeth command line argument is the name used to call the program.
  It is not necessarily the program's canonical name.
  Status:   Already done.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Easy.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on February 26, 2017.

125.  Allow setting the Run feature's command line parameters.
  Benefit:  Medium.  Would help speed up demonstrating features.
  Status:   Already done.  See the desktop's "to handle run" routine.
            The parameter string can be further customized.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Hard.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

137.  Add a "Running Options…" menu item in the editor.
  At program start up, populate the running options
  based on the current instance's settings
  (such as /left, /right, and /tt).  Use these command line options
  when a program is run using the Run menu item or Ctrl-R.
  Status:   Already done.
  Benefit:  Major.  Will make it much easier to demonstrate features.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Windows programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 2, 2017

007.  Have a configuration file.
  Some users have preferences that they would like to keep from
  one session of Cal to another.  For example:
    font name,
    font size,
    font name for UI features,
    main window size and location,
    initial size and location of the main window
      of a program run by the compiler,
    state of the "most recently used menus" feature
  Store these settings in a configuration file, in Plain English.
  Include a prominent note that the program updates these settings,
    based on user actions.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Benefit:  Possibly does more harm than good.
            Most of the value of this feature can
            be achieved using command line options.
  Status:   Won't do.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

069. Update the documentation to discuss configuration.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Status:  request.
  Benefit:  Important -- the documentation needs to be accurate.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demo difficulty:  Easy.
  Test difficulty:  not applicable.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

130.  Allow calling a config.txt file from the command line.
  Benefit:  Might do more harm than good.
            A non- Plain English format would be awkward.
            A Plain English format would be dangerous,
            because it tempt users to use CAL as an interpreter,
            or even as a worm.
            Would allow entering long command lines
            in a text file, which is much easer to view
            and edit than a command line.  (And can be
            much longer.)  Would need to have an extension,
            to avoid being compiled.
  Status:   Won't do.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Hard.
  Testing difficulty:  Hard.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

131.  Allow the config.txt file to be in Plain English.
  Benefit:  Might do more harm than good.
            A Plain English format would be dangerous,
            because it tempt users to use CAL as an interpreter,
            or even as a worm.  Perhaps it could be restricted
            to just making "requests" similar to the command line?
            But arbitrarily restricting Plain English

258.  In editor, add a "list and run" menu item.
  Perhaps with a different name.
  Reasons for not doing:
  1)  Conjunctions in feature names are a code smell.
  2)  It only does two pieces (which can already be easily done)
      of a larger process (which I have not scoped yet).
  3)  To be consistent with this feature, a similar
      command line feature would need to be added.
  4)  But that command line feature would have questionable
      design choices for reporting success or failure.
  5)  That command line feature would not be consistent
      with use in "one action per line" batch scripts.
  6)  That command line feature would be the beginning of
      an of-order-summorial increase in the number of
      command line features.
  7)  That command line feature would need to be documented,
      and the documentation would be confusing.
  8)  Very few users would find it useful.
  9)  There are really only two use cases for it.
      One is part of a build finalization process,
      which needs to produce a file with debugging information
      that corresponds to the released-and-tested .exe file.
      The other is for intermediate builds while waiting for
      a crashing bug to occur.  When crashing bugs are
      eliminated, this use case disappears.

099.  Use a checkmark instead of a highlight color for the current font height.
  Audience:  All users.
  Status:   Won't do.
  Benefit:  Might do more harm than good.
    The 8-bit ASCII character set does not include a checkmark.
    This is probably why Microsoft's implementation of checkmarked menus
    uses a custom hard-coded bitmap.  The closest 8-bit ascii characters
    are the bullet (#149) and the generic currency sign (#164).
    There are other symbols that look sort of like checkmarks
    (if you squint hard enough), but they mean "not", not "selected".
    Using unicode character #10003 or #10004 (#x2713 or #x2714)
    would produce a checkmark, but would require the compiler
    to deal gracefully with Unicode strings.

119.  Make command-line compiler return 0 on success.
  Status:   Tested, via batch script.
  Benefit:  Major.  Would allow automated build tools
            to include CAL in a pipeline.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.  Need to modify the compiler's
            "to add and compile the initialize before run
              and run and finalize after run routine"
  Status:   Already done.
  Demoing difficulty:  Hard.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Programmers.

135.  Add a command-line option to just run all the tests.
  Return 0 if all tests passed.
  Return a positive number if any test fails.
  (Cannot simply return the number of failed tests,
   because a return status of 259 is reserved by the kluge
   to indicate that the process or thread is still running.)
  Status:   Tested, via batch script.
  Benefit:  Major.  This would allow automated
            build verification tests in a build pipeline.

121.  Allow sending output to Standard Error.
  Status:   Tested, via batch script.
  Benefit:  Major.  Would allow other IDEs to make use of
            CAL's compiler error messages.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.  Would require using
            the Windows API to open and close Standard Error.

143.  A command-line way to call the "list" mode of the compiler.
  Status:   Tested, via batch script.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy 
           (once there is a command-line version of the compiler.)

221.  Make editor's sort definitions feature not add extra lines.
  When editing a source, the Sort Definitions feature
  adds a blank line after the comments at the top,
  and before the first definition.
  Each sorting adds another blank line.
  Status:  Demonstrated.  (cal-4700 also has this bug; the bug
           has been reported to cal-4700's maintainers)
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Benefit:  Medium.  The bug requires either manual clean-up
            after sorting, or invalidates how source code
            control systems use diff to verify that files
            have not changed.

277.  Cache whether methods are found in libraries.
  Status:    Tested.
  Benefit:   Critical -- may prevent crashes in GetProcAddress.
  Audience:  Application users.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Already done.  Existing tests
    verify that the cached functionality still works.
    The implementation exercises the uncaching feature.
