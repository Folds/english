  say no.

to draw a terminal:
  if the terminal is nil, exit.
  save the current canvas.
  mask only outside the terminal's box.
  draw and fill the terminal's box with the black color.
  write the terminal's quoras in the terminal's box.
  restore the current canvas.

to draw a terminal (last quora):
  if the terminal is nil, exit.
  get a quora from the terminal's quoras (backwards).
  if the quora is nil, exit.
  save the current canvas.
  get a quora box given the terminal's box (last quora).
  mask only outside the quora box.
  draw and fill the quora box with the black color.

  restore the current canvas.

to finalize a terminal:
  clear the terminal.
  destroy the terminal.

to get a quora box given a box (last quora):
  if the terminal is nil, clear the quora box; exit.
  count the terminal's quoras returning a count.
  if the count is less than 1, clear the quora box; exit.
  subtract 1 from the count.
  put the count times 1/4 inch in a height.
  put the box into the quora box.
  put the quora box's top plus 1/4 inch into the quora box's bottom.
  move the quora box down the height.

to handle an event given a terminal:

  show the terminal (last quora).

to handle an event given a terminal (enter key):
  relinquish control.

to handle an event given a terminal (key down):
  if the event's key is the backspace key, handle the event given the terminal (backspace key); exit.

  if the event's byte is not printable, exit.
  append the event's byte to the terminal's reply.
  append the event's byte to the terminal's quoras' last's string.

the terminal is a terminal.

a terminal is a thing with
  a box,
