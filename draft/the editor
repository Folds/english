  \ uncommented part

to put a source's sheets/copy into a sheets/copy:
  if the source is nil, put 0 into the sheets/copy; exit.
  divide the source's text's selected row count by the source's rows/sheet giving a quotient and a remainder.
  put the quotient into the sheets/copy.
  if the remainder is not 0, add 1 to the sheets/copy.

a rows/sheet is a number.

  put the block's last row into a row.
  if the row is nil, break.
  if the row is blank, remove the row from the block's rows; destroy the row; repeat.
  if the row's string starts with "\", remove the row from the block's rows; destroy the row; repeat.

to scrub some blocks:
  get a block from the blocks.
  if the block is nil, exit.
  scrub the block.
  repeat.

to scrub some blocks for extracting:
  get a block from the blocks.
  if the block is nil, exit.
  scrub the block for extracting.
  repeat.

a sheet number is a number.

a sheets/copy is a number.

to sort some blocks:
  if the blocks' first is the blocks' last, exit.
  split the blocks into some left blocks and some right blocks.
  sort the left blocks.
  sort the right blocks.
  loop.
  put the left blocks' first into a left block.
  put the right blocks' first into a right block.
  if the left block is nil, append the right blocks to the blocks; exit.
  if the right block is nil, append the left blocks to the blocks; exit.
  if the left block's name is greater than the right block's name, move the right block from the right blocks to the blocks; repeat.
  move the left block from the left blocks to the blocks.
  repeat.

to sort definitions given a source:
  if the source is nil, exit.
  create some blocks given the source's text's rows.
  scrub the blocks.
  name the blocks.

  deselect the source's text.
  renumber the source's text's rows.
  destroy the blocks.

a source is a thing with

  a colorized flag,
  a text.

to track a source given an event:
  if the source is nil, exit.
  if the event is nil, exit.
  extend any selection in the source's text given the event's spot.

  autoscroll the source's text given the spot and the flag.
  extend any selection in the source's text given the spot.
  if the source's text's selection is the selection, repeat.
  set the flag.
  put the source's text's selection into the selection.
  repeat.

to uncomment any selected rows in a source:
  if the source is nil, exit.
  loop.
  get a row from the source's text's rows.
  if the row is nil, exit.
