\ This "no bonus" source code file contains stub routines,
\ which do not do anything.  The programmer (or a batch script)
\ can swap in "bonus" source code to replace this file.
\ For example, a batch script could delete this file
\ (or rename it to have a file extension), and instead include
\ a "bonus" source code file that had different versions
\ of these routines.  This allows a batch script to verify
\ (for example) how the program handles a test failure,
\ without needing to modify the production code.
