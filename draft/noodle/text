\ here are the text rules:
\   in a non-wrapped text, the rows end with a return byte.
\   in a wrapped text, the rows end with either a return byte or a space.
\   when text is converted to a string,
\     linefeed bytes are added after return bytes.
\   when a string is converted to text, linefeed bytes are removed.
\   there is always at least one row.
\   there is always a return byte at the end of the last row.

\ this source file contains routines that use texts,
\ rows of texts, carets, anchors, positions, and text selections.
\ of the types listed in this paragraph, texts and rows are things;
\ the others are not.
