  limit the color's saturation to 0 and 1000.
  scale the color's lightness given 1000/240.
  limit the color's lightness to 0 and 1000.

to convert a colorref to a rgb:
  privatize the colorref.
  shift the colorref right 0 bits.
  put the colorref into the rgb's red byte.
  shift the colorref right 8 bits.
  put the colorref into the rgb's green byte.
  shift the colorref right 8 bits.
