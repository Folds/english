This file lists issues that have been demonstrably fixed
(but not yet automatically regression-tested)
in the Plain English programming environment.
All of these fixes have been fully demonstrated.
The Plain English programming environment is called Cal.
Currently, the file has a .txt extension,
so that it will not be compiled into the executable.

The list of outstanding issues is in issues.txt.
Done issues.txt explains how the issues are rated.
                It has issues that are marked won't do,
                and fixes that have been demonstrated
                    and automatically regression-tested.

\ ======================================
   
The following requests have been completed.
The program's change log is implicit
in the source code repository's change log.
These items should occasionally be moved to fixed issues.txt.

\ ======================================
   
The following requests have been demonstrated, and have test plan(s),
but have not yet been tested.

070.  Don't hide programs outside of the program's window.
  Currently, the program grabs a screenshot when it starts.
  The screenshot includes the full screen,
  not just the area the program is supposed to be in.
  This means that other programs are hidden
  whenever Cal is the active window.
  The benefit is important -- most Windows and Linux programmers
    alternate working in their IDEs and doing other things.
  The difficulty is hard -- it should not require much code,
    but it is not obvious which code needs to be fixed.
  The status is demonstrated.
  The audiences are Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Demoing would be easy.  Windows programmers and Linux programmers
     would demo it all the time, but some full-screen users would only demo it
     when Cal did not occupy the full screen
     (or when they use two side-by-side instances of Cal).
  Testing would be hard.  The test would need to check that
     the size metadata of the bitmap used by the main window
     was consistent with the intended size of the main window.
     This would use the bitmapinfoheader feature of the Win32 API.

118.  A command-line version of the compiler.
  Benefit:  Major.  Would allow a programmer to automatically
            trigger a build upon every commit to a source-code
            repository.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.  Would require changing
            compiler's output location from inside CAL
            to either nowhere, or Standard Error.
            Might require not opening the GUI.  Would require
            the program returning 0 on success, 1 on failure.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Programmers.

119.  Make command-line compiler return 0 on success.
  Benefit:  Major.  Would allow automated build tools
            to include CAL in a pipeline.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.  Need to modify the compiler's
            "to add and compile the initialize before run
              and run and finalize after run routine"
  Status:   Already done.

  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

120.  Make command-line compiler return 1 on failure.
  Benefit:  Major.  Would allow automated build tools
            to include CAL in a pipeline.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.  Need to modify the compiler's
            "to add and compile the initialize before run

  Demoing difficulty:  Hard.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

135.  Add a command-line option to just run all the tests.
  0 = all tests passed.
  Return a positive number if any test fails.
  (Cannot simply return the number of failed tests,
   because a return status of 259 is reserved by the kluge
   to indicate that the process or thread is still running.)
  Benefit:  Major.  This would allow automated
            build verification tests in a build pipeline.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

121.  Allow sending output to Standard Error.
  Benefit:  Major.  Would allow other IDEs to make use of
            CAL's compiler error messages.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.  Would require using
            the Windows API to open and close Standard Error.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

136:  Output test failure messages to StdErr when tests requested.
  Use the same infrastructure as the compile failure messages.
  Only do this when testing is requested on the command line.
  Benefit:  Medium.  This would make it easier to interpret
            build verification test results in a build pipeline.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

122.  Make compiler errors sent to StdErr use a standard format.
  For example, the format for specifying the problem,
  the problematic source file, and the problematic line
  used by GCC.  (The text of the problem specification itself
  can still be in Plain English.)
  Benefit:  Major.  Would allow other IDEs to make use of
            CAL's compiler error messages.

221.  Make editor's sort definitions feature not add extra lines.
  When editing a source, the Sort Definitions feature
  adds a blank line after the comments at the top,
  and before the first definition.
  Each sorting adds another blank line.
  Status:  Demonstrated.  (cal-4700 also has this bug; the bug
           has been reported to its cal-4700's maintainers)
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Benefit:  Medium.  The bug requires either manual clean-up
            after sorting, or invalidates how source code
            control systems use diff to verify that files
            have not changed.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on April 30, 2017.

144.  Allow viewing result of running a program.
  Add a menu item to review the run's result.
  259 means the program is still active.
  If the recently run program has finished, show its return code.
  Benefit:  Minor.  Helps demonstrate command-line compiler return code.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.

    (Demonstrated on WINE, but not on Windows.)
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy -- if and only if
    it is possible to distinguish Windows kluges from WINE kluges.
  Demoing difficulty:  Hard.
  Testing difficulty:  Profound.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 17, 2014.

089.  Allow the maximum number of displayed regression tests to depend
  only on the amount of room available for displaying them.
  Specifically, do not require the corresponding menu handler
  to be hardcoded in the menu handler switch.
  Audience: Programmers.
  Status:   Implemented.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy, after there are many tests that all pass.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

090.  Allow user to copy a test result to the clipboard by clicking on it.
  Audience: Programmers.
  Status:   Demonstrated.
  Benefit:  Important.  This allows using the regression test feature
     to output text to the clipboard, which means run-time values can
     be copied into code sources for reading and munging by the user.
     In turn, this makes it much easier to fix many bugs.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

013.  Allow changing the main window size and location at run-time.
  Currently, the main window is fixed at the top-left corner of the screen.
  Currently, the main window's size is fixed.
  Currently, the program does not have mouse cursors available
  for changing widths, changing heights, nor dragging window corners.
  Status:  Demonstrated.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Benefit:  Important.  It will allow users to adjust the size of Cal
            depending on how important their distractions from Cal are.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Hard.

  Benefit:  Minor.
  Status: Demonstrated.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 12, 2014.

011.  Allow the menus (and status bar) to fold to two rows.
  Currently, Cal's menus and status bar need about 1000 pixels of width
  at the top of the screen.  This forces Cal to be at least 1000 pixels wide.
  (The width is approximate, because Cal does not check whether Windows
   has more than 96 pixels per inch.)
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Benefit:  Important.  Most users would need this feature
    to be able to put two instances of Cal side-by-side.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Hard (without the ability
    to adjust the main window's width at run time);
    Easy (if the user can adjust the main window's width at run time).
  Testing difficulty: Medium.
  Status:  Demonstrated.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

019.  Allow the "Run" feature to launch the new instance of Cal
next to the first instance, instead of covering the first instance.
  Audience:  programmers.
  Benefit:  Probably important.  This would allow simultaneously
    using the draft program, and viewing the relevant source code.
  Status: Demonstrated.

032.  Adjust the number of tabs, depending on the initial width of the main window.
  Status: Demonstrated.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation Difficulty:  easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  easy.
  Testing difficulty:  medium.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

038.  Add a vertical scroll bar.
  Currently, the user can move vertically in a document by panning
    (with the mouse), or by using the up and down arrow keys,
    or by using the page up and page down keys.
  None of these features indicate how much more document
    is above or below the currently shown region.
  None of these features allow the user to quickly
    go to a particular place in the document.
  Panning requires one click-and-drag of the viewable height,
    plus another drag of the viewable height,
    per page of text being panned.
  Audience -- Windows programmers.
     Windows users expect to be able to use the scroll bar to:
     quickly find a place in the document,
     quickly scroll through then entire document,
     fine-tune their location in the document.
  The benefit is important -- this feature will allow people to
     use large documents without needing Ctrl-F
     every time they want to find something.
  The status is a demonstrated.
  The implementation difficulty is hard.
     A scroll bar has many sub-features,
     all of which need to be implemented similarly to a standard.
     The relevant standard is Windows' implementation of vertical
     scroll bars.  Each individual sub-feature is easy.
  The testing difficulty is hard, for the same reasons
     as the implemenation difficulty.
     Each individual sub-feature has a medium testing difficulty.
  The demoing difficulty is medium.
     Each individual sub-feature can be demoed easily.
  This feature will be much easier to implement
     once name spaces are available.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

102.  Add a command line option to choose a fixed-width font.
  If the system has "Courier New" available, use it.
  Benefit:  Very important -- many potential users did not even try
            the system, because the first font they saw was the
            old default font, and they did not see how to change the font.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Hard.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Status:  Demonstrated.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on April 11, 2014.

112.  Enable vertical mouse-wheel scrolling in editor panes.
  Make using the mouse-wheel similar to dragging the scrollbar cab.
  Status:  Demonstrated.
  Benefit: Important.  Most users of web browsers rely
           on mouse-wheel scrolling.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
           Requires handling another Windows event. (#522.)
