to wrap a number given a number called alpha and a number called omega:
  wrap the number given the alpha and the omega and 0.

to wrap a number given a number called alpha and a number called omega and another number:
  if the number is wrapped given the alpha and the omega, exit.
  if the alpha is the omega,
    put the alpha in the number; exit.
  put the omega minus the alpha in a number called period.
  add 1 to the period.
