This file is the start of a bug-tracking system
for the Plain English programming environment.
The Plain English programming environment is called Cal.
Currently, the file has a .txt extension,
so that it will not be compiled into the executable.

This file has outstanding issues.
Demoed fixes.txt has fixes that have been demonstrated,
                 but are not automatically regression tested.
Done issues.txt  explains how the issues are rated.
                 It has issues that are marked won't do,
                 and fixes that have been demonstrated
                     and automatically regression-tested.

\ ======================================
   
The following requests have been completed.
They are either marked won't do, or have been
both demonstrated and automatically regression tested.
The program's change log is implicit
in the source code repository's change log.
These items should occasionally be moved to done issues.txt.

  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on April 25, 2017.

218.  Change the tabstrip's ellipsis character in proportional fonts.
  If there is not enough space in a tab for a full descriptor,
  the descriptor is abbreviated.  In fixed-width fonts,
  the ellipsis character is "…".  To save space, proportional
  fonts use "„".  The unicode "modifier letter low tilde" (U+02F7)
  would look better, and be less confusing, in proportional fonts.
  Status:    Request.
  Benefit:   Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy, if can draw Unicode strings on-screen.

133.  Allow marking comments in the vertical scroll bar.
  Benefit:  Medium.  Would make it easier to find
            major section breaks in source code by scrolling.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
            Might be hard to make run efficiently.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.

  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

041.  Use the correct number of pixels per inch.
  Currently, Cal assumes that there are 96 pixels per inch.
  Various versions of Windows (or its Control Panel options)
  can have different pixel densities,
  such as 72, 96, 120, 144, 150, et cetera pixels per inch.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Profound.  Windows lies about
    the screen resolution to any program that is not
    registered as understanding screen resolutions.
    Even when Windows does not lie by saying 96 dpi,
    it approximates the answer to 96 dpi, 120 dpi, or 144 dpi.
    It needs a short procedure, but the procedure
    will need to make a Windows API call.  Also, there are
    several places in the code that implicitly use 96 ppi.
  Audience:  Windows programmers.  (specifically, those who
    have pixel densities other than 96 pixels per inch.)
  Demoing difficulty:  Hard.  Changing the Windows pixel density
    requires re-starting the computer.
  Testing difficulty:  Profound.
  Status:  request.

219.  From "the editor", factor out blocks and sorting code into a "text sorter" file.
  Status:    Designed.  Do after project can handle multiple folders.
  Audience:  Programmers.
  Benefit:   Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Easy.
  Demoing difficulty:  Not applicable.

  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on April 27, 2017.
 
034.  Have an option to search upward, such as Shift-F3.
  Audience:  Windows programmers.
  Status:  request.
  Benefit:  Might do more harm than good.
            CAL does not have the Shift-<feature> idiom
            to perform a <feature> in the opposite direction.
            For example, it uses Ctrl-I and Ctrl-O
            to indent and outdent, instead of Tab and Shift-Tab.
            Also, each CAL feature should be accessible
            from the menu.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

252.  Document how to find lines of code based on memory addresses.
  If a program crashes, and if a program like WinCrashReport
  is installed, it is possible to view the stack.
  The stack will include addresses of function calls in
  the *.exe.  It is possible to use a *.lst file's routines
  section to roughly find which line of source code
  corresponded to the address of the function call.
  Status:  Request.
  Audience:  Windows programmers.
  Benefit:   Major -- helps diagnose crashing bugs.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Hard.
  Testing difficulty:  Not applicable.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on June 2, 2017.

253.  Document that null pointer errors cause crashes.
  Add a paragraph or page to the instructions.

  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Testing difficulty:  Profound.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 15, 2014.

126.  A way to export CAL's tabs' source names and labels.
  Benefit:  Medium.  Would make it easier to test some features.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Medium.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 1, 2017.

123.  A way to test event queueing and dequeing.
  Currently, enque and deque go through a global event queue.
  It would be good to be able to verify that events can be
  processed without affecting the user-visible state of CAL.
  Benefit:  Major.  Many features are currently untested
            because of this issue.  Also, writing the code
            to take a windows message, create an event,
            enque and deque the event, and pass the event
            to a handler method is error-prone.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  n/a (use tests instead)
  Testing difficulty:  Medium (once implemented).
  Audience:  Windows and Linux programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on February 28, 2017.

050.  On WINE systems, prevent the following error messages:
  Currently, the "wine cmd" shell reports something like the following after Cal quits:
err:ole:CoGetClassObject class {96749377-3391-11d2-9ee3-00c04f797396} not registered

err:ole:CoGetClassObject no class object {96749377-3391-11d2-9ee3-00c04f797396} could be created for context 0x7
  Audience:  Linux programmers.
  Status:  request.
  Benefit:  Important.  This problem is caused by the talker failing to find
    WINE's sapi.dll; this failure prevents Linux users from listening
    to CAL's text-to-speech features.
  Implementation difficulty:  Profound.
  Demo difficulty:  Hard, unless the programmer is using WINE (which makes it easy).
  Test difficulty:  Profound.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

092.  Document how to use git to manage the code.

  Status:  request.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Hard.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

036.  Implement code-folding.  (Part 1)
  For example, it would be nice to view a summarized list
    of these feature requests.
  It would also be nice to be able to scroll through
    all of the procedure headers in a file, in just a few screens.
  The status is a request.  A simple version could be implemented by:
    just display the first row of each block,
    hide the blank lines between blocks,
    show a symbol that the code has been abbreviated,
    allow the user to click on the symbol to see the rest of the block,
    have a "fold all" feature and an "unfold all" feature.
  The benefit is important -- it will help find code,
    and help know what features are available.
    This will help the system scale to have more features.
  The difficulty level is medium.
  The testing difficulty is medium.
  The audience is programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

037.  Implement code-folding.  (Part 2)
  For example, it would be nice to view a summarized list
    of these feature requests, with the implementation difficulty,
    demoing difficulty, testing difficulty, benefit rating,
    audience, and status all in the summary.
  The status is a request.  It would be possible to have a request
    output a two-line summary, and have the code-folding feature
    (from Part 1) show the two line summary.
  The difficulty level is medium.
  The testing difficulty is medium.
  The audience is programmers.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

091.  Allow using mouse and windows events to change the window size at run-time.
  Currently, the main window is fixed at the top-left corner of the screen.
  As of March 15, 2014, the main window's size has one of two sizes:
  full screen, or a "restored" size that is calculated at startup.
  Currently, the program does not have mouse cursors available
  for changing widths, changing heights, nor dragging window corners.
  When the mouse is close to the edges of the window, and the window
  is in "restore" mode, change the cursor accordingly.
  If the user clicks-and-drags the mouse
  while the mouse has such a cursor,
  adjust the window size and location.  Do not allow the window height
  or width to exceed the corresponding screen dimension.
  Status:  request.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Benefit:  Minor.  It will allow users to adjust the size of Cal
            depending on how important their distractions from Cal are.
  Implementation difficulty:  Hard.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Hard.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

054.  Add namespaces.
  Several features currently use names that would be very handy
    for describing parts of new features.
  This pre-emption makes it far more difficult to add features.
  The audience is programmers.
  The implementation difficulty is profound.
  The testing difficulty is medium.
  Benefit: Very important.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.
  
040.  Reduce the font leading (in fonts other than the old default font).
  Currently, fonts like Courier New have a large gap between rows.
  This gap is much larger than in other text editors,
  such as gedit or Notepad.
  This leading could be reduced to typical heights.
  Benefit:  Minor.
  Audiences:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Status:  Request.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty:  Easy.
  Testing difficulty:  Medium.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

004.  Allow true vertical panning.
  Currently, the user can pan a text document
  by right-clicking and dragging the mouse.
  Unfortunately, this often causes the text to move over to the left,
  so that the left part of the text is off the screen.
  This is disorienting.
  The current work-around is to pan up-and-to-the-right,
  or pan down-and-to-the-right.
  It would be possible to modify
     the right-click-and-drag mouse event handler
     so that if the item being viewed is a text file,
     and the absolute value of the mouse's change in x is less
     than an arbitrary fraction of
     the absolute value of the mouse's change in y,
     the pan is purely vertical.
  The audiences are Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  The benefit is important -- the non-vertical panning
  is very jarring to new users of the system.
  The status is designed.
  Implementation would be easy.
  Demoing would be easy.
  Testing would be easy.  The test could propose
    possible mouse event delta-x and delta-y values,
    and verify that the editor can compute
    the intended delta-x and delta-y values.
    The test would not need to actually pan the screen.
  Requested by Jasper Paulsen on March 7, 2014.

017.  Automate collecting the unit tests.
In practice, automated testing needs tool support for building test suites.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Status:  request.
  Benefit:  Important -- this makes testing much easier.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demo difficulty:  Easy.
  Test difficulty:  Medium.

012.  If there are multiple rows of menu letters, fade out the irrelevant row(s)
while a letter's menu is visible.
  Audience:  Windows programmers and Linux programmers.
  Benefit:  Important.  This will mitigate the confusion
    caused by folding the menu bar.
  Implementation difficulty:  Medium.
  Demoing difficulty: Hard (without the ability
    to adjust the main window's width at run time);
    Easy (if the user can adjust the main window's width at run time).
  Testing difficulty:  Hard.
