\ The portions of this file that are from CAL-4700
\ are copyright 2017 by the Osmosian Order.
\ The remainder is copyright 2017 by Jasper Paulsen.

\ Only include routines in this file that:
\  * Use the context,
\  * Optionally draw or stroke,
\  * Do not refresh the screen, and
\  * and either:
\    ** Do not modify the context, or
\    ** Restore the context to the same state
\       as at the beginning of the routine.
\ In other words, these routines "keep" the original context
\ so it can still be used or changed by the next routine.

\ The "modder" file has routines that change the context.
