The goal of this project is to identify and/or implement easy-to-use tools
for developing applications in the Plain English programming language.

The current compiler uses files (with no file extension)
in a single folder as its source code, and produces 32-bit x86 assembly
Portable Executable files.  The compiled programs use 8-bit ASCII,
and run on Windows systems (such as Microsoft Windows XP
through Windows 10, and WINE). 

This project is a "fork" that started with version 3040
of the Osmosian Order's IDE and compiler.  This project also includes
code from version 4700 of the Osmosian Order's IDE and compiler.
The Osmosian Order considers this project's IDE
to be "contrary to Osmosian principles,"
and does not want their name associated with it.
This project (and the project's documentation) only use the word
Osmosian where it is necessary to indicate which portions
of the concept and code remain under the Osmosian Order's
copyright.  This project uses the term "Plain English" to indicate
that this project's language syntax is fully compatible
with the language syntax of the Osmosian Order's official releases.

Future issues include:
* Choosing an open-source license.
* Deciding how to organize source code files and/or folders.
* Choosing whether to compile or interpret the source code.
* Choosing what language to emit
  (such as C, CLR, Java byte code, x86 assembly, or something else).
