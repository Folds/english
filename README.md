The goals of this project are to:
* develop a general purpose open-source English programming language, and
* to identify and/or implement easy-to-use tools
  for developing applications in said English programming language.

Currently, the high-level features of both the language
and the development environment need to be worked out.
Issues include:
* Choosing an open-source license.
* Choosing a name for the language.
* Choosing whether to compile or interpret the source code.
* Choosing what language to emit
  (such as C, CLR, Java byte code, x86 assembly, or something else).
* Language syntax (such as keywords, namespaces, et cetera).

It is practical to develop in English.
The Osmosian Order (www.osmosian.com) has developed
an iconoclastic IDE in a similar language called Plain English.
With the permission of the Osmosian Order, this project
hopes to develop an English programming language with
similar syntax to Plain English.

This project will be different from the Osmosian project in that:
* The language syntax might be subtly different.
* The language will be designed to scale
  both down to small projects and up to large projects.
* The development environment will be designed
  to be tool(s) in a developer's toolbox,
  not a self-contained minimalist IDE.
* Use of automated tests and git will be encouraged.
