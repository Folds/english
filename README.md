The goal of this project is to identify and/or implement
easy-to-use tools for developing applications
in the Plain English programming language.

The current compiler uses files (with no file extension)
as its source code, and produces 32-bit x86 assembly
Portable Executable files.  The source code files can either
be in a single folder (that does not contain a "noodle"
subfolder), or can be in a single folder and its immediate
subfolders (if one of the subfolders is named "noodle").
"Writer" files and spell-checker lexicons are not compiled.
The compiled programs use 8-bit ASCII, and run on Windows systems
(such as Microsoft Windows XP through Windows 10, and WINE). 

This project is an authorized "dynamic fork" that started
with version 3040 of the Osmosian Order's IDE and compiler.
This project also includes code from version 4700
of the Osmosian Order's IDE and compiler.
The Osmosian Order considers this project's IDE to be
"contrary to Osmosian principles," and does not want
their name associated with it.  This project
(and the project's documentation) only use the word Osmosian
where it is necessary to indicate which portions of the concept
and code remain under the Osmosian Order's copyright.
This project uses the term "Plain English" to indicate that
this project's language syntax is fully compatible with
the language syntax of the Osmosian Order's official releases.

Future issues include:
* Choosing an open-source license.
* Improving regression-test coverage.
* The compiler can be run from the command line.
  Can it be packaged as an IDE plug-in?
